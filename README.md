Welcome to my repository!  
  
This is where I publish my projects (along a short description). Some of them were made as school projects, some were just projects I made up to practice.  
  
The projects:  

1. Rummy game  
It is a website, one of my first projects, designed for PC.  
You can try it by opening it in two different browsers. After you enter your name, you will see other players, then by clicking on their name, you will send invite, which they can accept.  
As it was not intended for the public (and I know the rules), there are no game rules coded, you can move cards as you want.

2. Duck game  
It is an infinitely running skill game running on a website, designed for PC. The player is playing as a duck, you need to dodge and/or shoot the enemies coming your way.  
The files are in this repository (only html and js, images are not included).

3. Workout planner  
It is a mobile first designed website, wrote in Angular. It was made as a school project.  
It lets you create your workout plan, and provides a calendar which shows you the routines you will want to do on specific days. (Saving changes you make as the test user are turned off.)  
The files are in the repository.
