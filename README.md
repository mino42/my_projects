Welcome to my repository!
My projects:

1. Rummy game
It is a website, one of my first projects, designed for PC.
You can try it by opening it in two different browsers. After you enter your name, you will see other players, then by clicking on their name, you will send invite, which the they can accept.
I made no gamerules in the code, you can move cards as you want.
