Welcome to my repository!  
  
This is where I collect my projects (along a short description). Some of them were made as school or work related projects, some were just projects I made up for practice.  
  
The projects:  
  
1. Rummy game  
A website, one of my first projects, designed for PC.  
You can try it by opening it in two different browsers. After you enter your name, you will see other players, then by clicking on their name, you will send invite, which they can accept.  
As it was not intended for public (and I know the game rules), there are no game rules coded, you can move cards as you want.  
Used languages/libraries: HTML, CSS, JS, PHP.

2. Duck game  
It is an infinitely running skill game running on a website, designed for PC. The player is playing as a duck, you need to dodge and/or shoot the enemies coming your way.  
The files are in this repository (only html and js, images are not included).  
Used languages/libraries: HTML, CSS, JS.

3. Workout planner  
It is a mobile first designed website, wrote in Angular. It was made as a school project.  
It lets you create your workout plan, and provides a calendar which shows you the routines you will want to do on specific days. (Saving changes you make as the test user are turned off.)  
The files are in the repository.  
Used languages/libraries: HTML, CSS, JS (typescript), Angular.

A website for creating use case diagrams.

5. A mapbox test project  
It's a website with a map and a georefered image. There are four layers you can draw on. On two layers only lanes, on the other two, only polygons.
Whatever you draw, is added to the selected layer, where you can edit and delete it from the menu on the right. For polygons and lines, their color will change to blue, when you are able to move their points around. It is also possible to export/import your data.  
It is best opened in chrome in my experience.  
Used languages/libraries: HTML, CSS, JS, Mapbox.
